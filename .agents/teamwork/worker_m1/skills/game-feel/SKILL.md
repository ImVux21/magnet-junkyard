  Add "juice" and game feel that makes actions satisfying — screen shake, hit-stop/freeze
  frames, tweened/eased motion, squash & stretch, knockback, and layered audio-visual
  feedback — as engine-neutral techniques that pair with the detected engine's tween,
  particle, and camera APIs. Use when the user mentions game feel, juice, "make it feel
  good/punchy", screen shake, hit stop, screen freeze, easing, squash and stretch, impact
  frames, or feedback/polish on hits, jumps, pickups, and deaths.

# Game feel (juice)

The difference between a mechanic that *works* and one that feels *good* is feedback: the
layered, slightly-exaggerated response an action provokes. This skill covers the engine-
neutral techniques — screen shake, hit-stop, easing, squash & stretch, knockback, and stacked
feedback — and tells you how to apply them without burying the underlying simulation. It
**adds polish on top of** an existing mechanic; it does not implement the mechanic.

## When to use

- Use when an action (hit, jump, dash, pickup, death, button press) is mechanically correct
  but feels weak, weightless, or unsatisfying, and you want it to feel responsive and punchy.
- Use to add screen shake, hit-stop/freeze frames, eased motion, squash & stretch, knockback,
  flashes, or to layer multiple feedback channels onto one event.
- Use to decide *how much* juice is enough and where it crosses into noise.

**When *not* to use:** for the raw controller math (jump height, coyote time) use the
`platformer` genre and the engine movement skill. For camera *follow/deadzone/orbit* framing
use `camera-systems` (this skill only triggers the shake). For mixing, ducking, and adaptive
music use `audio-design`. For shader-based dissolves/flashes use `shader-programming` and the
engine shader skill. For the concrete tween/particle node APIs, use the engine animation skill
(`godot-animation`, `unity-animation`).

## Core principle: feedback is layered and exaggerated

One satisfying hit is usually **5–8 tiny responses firing together** within ~100 ms: a sound,
a particle burst, a brief hit-stop, a flash, a knockback, a small screen shake, and a number
popping up. Each is cheap; stacked, they read as "impact". Two rules keep it from becoming a
mess: **(1)** exaggerate *briefly* and return to rest (juice is transient, not a new resting
state); **(2)** scale juice to event importance — a footstep is not a boss death.

## Core workflow

1. **Confirm the event hooks exist.** Juice attaches to discrete events: `on_hit`, `on_land`,
   `on_pickup`, `on_death`, `on_fire`. If the mechanic doesn't emit these, add them first.
2. **Pick feedback channels per event** from the menu (sound, particles, shake, hit-stop,
   flash, knockback, tween, number pop). Start with 2–3; add until it reads, then stop.
3. **Make motion eased, not linear.** Route scale/position/UI changes through a tween with an
   ease (overshoot for "pop", ease-out for "settle"). Linear motion feels robotic.
4. **Reserve hit-stop and shake for impact.** They are the strongest, most abusable tools —
   short durations, scaled to importance, and never on routine actions.
5. **Keep feedback off the critical simulation.** Shake moves the *camera/visual*, not the
   body; hit-stop uses time scale or a real-time pause, not a gameplay-logic stall.
6. **Tune by importance tiers.** Define small/medium/large feedback presets and assign events
   to a tier, so the whole game's juice stays consistent and proportional.
7. **Verify by playing and watching.** Trigger the event repeatedly; confirm the feedback
   fires, returns to rest, and is not nauseating or input-blocking. Report what you observed
   (does shake decay? does input still register during hit-stop?).
